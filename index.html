            <h3>My Chilhood</h3>
            <p>
                During my chilhood years, I was always interested in the things that I could do. 
                I love to play with my friends and learn new things. I also enjoyed playing with my 
                cousins and other children. My favorite thing about my childhood is that I can go anywhere 
                without any worry.

            <h3>My Teenage Life</h3>
            <p>
                During my teenage years, I could understand why it can be difficult to raise a child while you are still a child yourself. 
                I am grateful to my parents for choosing to provide a better experience for me. Through it all, they have supported me. 
                They have always helped me in every way they could. They have always shown me how to be resilient and independent.

            <h3>My Adulthood</h3>

            <p>
                The challenges of adulthood are even more contemporary, and better decisions are made regarding family, career, and academic matters. 
                It has been an up-and-down journey for me as a young adult. 
                I had to learn how to fend for myself, work hard, and be independent. 
                I have also learned that it is not always easy to make friends and find the right people to hang out with. 
                It is important to know what your values are and how they can help you achieve them.

                &#8594; Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side).Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.
